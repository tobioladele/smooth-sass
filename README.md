# Smooth sass
#### A collection of sass classes

Smooth sass is  another CSS toolkit. Itâ€™s basically a collection of the classes I find [myself](http://tobioladele.com) using in all of my projects. I made it to speed up development time and make relatively reduce the amount of css i have to write.

#Documentation

The documentation for smooth sass currently lives here: http://tobioladele.com/smooth-sass
It is divided into two versions.

#Developement version

This is the minified and compiled version of smooth-sass. All the different categories have been imported into one sass file (smooth_sass.scss).It basically for those who want to go straight into development.

#Production version

This is the large version. A folder containing all the various categories. Fully customizable for personalization.

#Alpha

Please note that smooth-sass is still in Alpha and yet to be fully tested. Feel free to leave feedback and requests on the Issues page.
